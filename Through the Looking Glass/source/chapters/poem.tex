\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse}
Child of the pure unclouded brow\\
And dreaming eyes of wonder!\\
Though time be fleet, and I and thou\\
Are half a life asunder,\\
Thy loving smile will surely hail\\
The love-gift of a fairy-tale.
\end{altverse}

	\begin{altverse}
I have not seen thy sunny face,\\
Nor heard thy silver laughter;\\
No thought of me shall find a place\\
In thy young life’s hereafter—\\
Enough that now thou wilt not fail\\
To listen to my fairy-tale.
\end{altverse}

	\begin{altverse}
A tale begun in other days,\\
When summer suns were glowing—\\
A simple chime, that served to time\\
The rhythm of oar rowing—\\
Whose echoes live in memory yet,\\
Though envious years would say »forget.«

	\begin{altverse}
Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread.\\
With bitter tidings laden,\\
Shall summon to unwelcome bed\\
A melancholy maiden!\\
We are but older children, dear,\\
Who fret to find our bedtime near.
\end{altverse}

	\begin{altverse}
Without, the frost, the blinding snow.\\
The storm-wind’s moody madness—\\
Within, the firelight’s ruddy glow,\\
And childhood’s nest of gladness.\\
The magic words shall hold thee fast:\\
Thou shalt not heed the raving blast.
\end{altverse}

	\begin{altverse}
And though the shadow of a sigh\\
May tremble through the story,\\
For »happy summer days« gone by,\\
And vanish’d summer glory—\\
It shall not touch with breath of bale\\
The pleasance of our fairy-tale.
\end{altverse}
